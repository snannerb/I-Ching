## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
Build me a web app that replicates the I ching divination method of 64 hexagram possibilities that each create a response of the name of the hexagram and its changing lines into additional hexagrams. When clicking "Throw Coins" button , three coins are thrown and land randomly either heads or tails  determining the visual corresponding hexagrams and changing lines that can be read by the viewer

### **Project Plan: I Ching Divination Simulator Web App**

---

### **1. Project Scope**

**Objective:**  
Develop a responsive web application that allows users to perform I Ching divination by generating and interpreting hexagrams based on simulated coin throws.  

---

### **2. Main Tasks**  

#### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**  
1. **Define Requirements:**  
   - Finalize functional and non-functional requirements based on the clarified request.  
2. **UI/UX Design:**  
   - Create wireframes and mockups for the web app (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
   - Design a simple, intuitive interface with a "Throw Coins" button and hexagram display.  
3. **Technical Stack Selection:**  
   - Choose front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (optional, for future scalability) technologies.  

---

#### **Phase 2: Development**  
**Task 1: Hexagram Generation Logic**  
   - Implement a random coin throw simulation using JavaScript.  
   - Map coin throw results to hexagram lines (solid, broken, and their changing variants).  
   - Generate and store a hexagram (6 lines) based on the 3-coin method.  

**Task 2: Visual Representation**  
   - Display hexagrams using solid (——) and broken (-- --) lines.  
   - Highlight changing lines with a distinct visual marker (e.g., color or symbol).  

**Task 3: Hexagram Interpretation**  
   - Create a database or JSON file to store hexagram names and interpretations.  
   - Display the generated hexagram name and interpretation.  
   - If changing lines exist, generate and display the second hexagram by transforming the changing lines.  

**Task 4: User Interface**  
   - Implement the "Throw Coins" button and "Reset" button (optional).  
   - Add a brief explanation of the I Ching divination method for first-time users.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Testing & Optimization**  
1. **Unit Testing:**  
   - Test the coin throw logic for randomness and accuracy.  
   - Verify hexagram generation and interpretation correctness.  
2. **UI Testing:**  
   - Ensure the app is responsive and works seamlessly across devices.  
3. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Optimize load times and ensure smooth interactions.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation**  
1. **Deployment:**  
   - Deploy the app to a web hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).  
2. **Documentation:**  
   - Write a user guide explaining how to use the app.  
   - Document the code and development process for future reference.  

---

### **3. Technical Considerations**  
1. **Front-End Technologies:**  
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vanilla JS for simplicity).  
2. **Randomization:**  
   - Use JavaScript's `Math.random()` or a library for unbiased randomness.  
3. **Hexagram Data Storage:**  
   - Store hexagram names and interpretations in a JSON file or hardcode them in the app.  
4. **Responsive Design:**  
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Flexbox/Grid for responsiveness.  
5. **Accessibility:**  
   - Ensure the app is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.  

---

### **4. Timeline**  
- **Week 1:** Planning, design, and technical setup.  
- **Week 2-3:** Development of hexagram generation, visual representation, and interpretation logic.  
- **Week 4:** UI implementation and testing.  
- **Week 5:** Deployment and documentation.  

---

### **5. Deliverables**  
- Fully functional I Ching Divination Simulator web app.  
- Source code and documentation.  
- Hosted app link for users to access.  

---

This plan ensures the project is completed efficiently while meeting all functional and technical requirements.
